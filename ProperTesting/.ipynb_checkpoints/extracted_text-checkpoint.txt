◁think▷Alright, I need to extract all the text from the given image and present it coherently. The image appears to be a handwritten note about asymptotic notation in the context of algorithms and data structures. Let me carefully read and transcribe the content:

The notes seem to cover the following topics:

1. Asymptotic notation - defining that a function is tending to one axis value (like a limit). An example given is e².
2. Asymptotic notation in data structures are used to represent time complexities of your algorithms.
3. It tells about the worst, average, and best case time complexity - time taken to execute a particular algorithm or code.
4. Denotations of best, worst, and average case are given:
   - O(Big O) → Worst case
   - Ω (Omega) → Best case
   - Θ (Theta) → Average case

I need to transcribe this information accurately without making any assumptions or additions. I'll present this text in a clear, coherent format.◁/think▷# Transcribed Text from Image:

The image contains handwritten notes about asymptotic notation in algorithm analysis. Here is the coherent text extracted:

---

**1) Asymptotic** Defines that a function is tending to one axis value. You can say it's a limit. **Example of Asymptotic Function could be e².**

**2) Asymptotic notation in Data Structures are used to represent time Complexities of your Algorithms.**

**3) It tells about the Worst, Average and Best Case time Complexity i.e time taken to execute a particular Algorithm or Code.**

**4) The denotions of Best, Worst and average case are:**
- **O (Big O) → Worst Case**
- **Ω (Omega) → Best Case**
- **Θ (Theta) → Average Case**

This text accurately represents the content visible in the handwritten image, focusing solely on the information presented without addition or assumption.
◁think▷Okay, let's extract the text from this image. The image shows a handwritten page with some bullet points and code snippets. The first section is labeled with a "5)" and discusses data structures and algorithm cost cases. The next part is labeled "6)" with example code in C. Then there's a section labeled "7)" with a comparison of time complexities.

I need to transcribe all the visible text accurately. The first paragraph under 5) talks about considering the worst-case scenario in algorithms. The code example in 6) is a simple loop incrementing a counter. The 7) section lists O(1) compared to other complexities like O(log n), O(n²), up to O(n!). The last part mentions increasing order and growth functions.

I should make sure to capture all the handwritten notes, including the arrows and diagrams. Avoid any errors in OCR if possible, but since it's handwritten, just transcribe as-is. Check for any missing or partial words and try to read them correctly based on context.◁/think▷5) But in data structure we always consider that what is the worst case of an algorithm or code that define that how much computational power computer consumes to execute.  

6) Ex: int count = 0  
   for (int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) {  
      count ++ ;  
   }  

In this code the loop has time complexity of O(n) and the count variable update has O(1) time complexity = O(n)  

7) O(1) > O(log n) > O(√n) > O(n) < O(n²) < O(n³) … < O(2ⁿ) < O(n!) < O(nⁿ)  
This is an increasing order (growth function)  

O(1)  
O(log n)  
O(√n)  
O(n)  
O(n²)  
O(n³)  
O(2ⁿ)  
O(n!)  
O(nⁿ)
