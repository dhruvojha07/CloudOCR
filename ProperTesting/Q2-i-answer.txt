Q.2 i) since the ‘i’ or 2.a’ is not present
(We can have multiple logics here for Pseudocode, and its not present in the book )
Part 1 of the answer
Step 1: IF START = NULL
Write "UNDERFLOW"
Go to Step 10
[END OF IF]
Step 2: SET PTR = START
Step 3: Repeat Steps 4 to 7 while PTR != NULL
Step 4: SET PREPTR = PTRStep 5: SET TEMP = PTR -> NEXT
Step 6: Repeat while TEMP != NULL
IF TEMP -> DATA = PTR -> DATA
SET PREPTR -> NEXT = TEMP -> NEXT
FREE TEMP
SET TEMP = PREPTR -> NEXT
ELSE
SET PREPTR = TEMP
SET TEMP = TEMP -> NEXT
[END OF IF]
[END OF LOOP]
Step 7: SET PTR = PTR -> NEXT
[END OF LOOP]
Step 8: Go to Sorting Process
Option 1:
public void RemoveDuplicates(Node<T> head)
{
// Iterate through the list
Node<T> iter = head;
while(iter != null)
{
// Iterate to the remaining nodes in the list
Node<T> current = iter;
while(current!= null && current.Next != null)
{
if(iter.Value == current.Next.Value)
{
current.Next = current.Next.Next;
}
current = current.Next;
}
iter = iter.Next;
}
}
